Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was a company that wanted a system to educate potential drivers before their test.  They wanted to be able to create accounts, book reservations, and take online tests.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did particularly well on my business requirements document.  I was able to outline all the needs of the system and document the rationale for each.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would go into more detail on my class diagram.  I think I could have added more classes and expanded the existing ones with more specifics.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the users needs by paying close attention to the interview with the client.  It is important to consider the user’s needs, as they are the ones who will use the system.  A system that does not meet the needs of the user is pointless.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by listening to the client, analyzing their needs, and breaking them down step by step.
